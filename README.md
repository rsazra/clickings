## controls
 the game mode is set with the options in the bottom left. <kbd>hits</kbd> is the default, in which the game length the selection is the number of accurate clicks the game will last for. <kbd>time</kbd> changes the game length options, and starts a countdown after the first click, tracked in the same place as the game length is set. 

 the length of the game is set with the numbers in the top left of the play area.

 <kbd>reset</kbd> starts the game over.

 at the end of the game, clicks per minute (<kbd>CPM</kbd>) and accuracy (<kbd>ACC</kbd>) are displayed in the top right.
